            <h3>COOKIES AND SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES</h3>
            <p>Like most online services, we and our partners use cookies and similar technologies to provide and personalize
                the Service, analyse use, target advertisements and prevent fraud. You can disable cookies in your browser

                business
                interests, such as to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>
